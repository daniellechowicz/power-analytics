### Import view
After pressing the first button, the data import view is visible. Select the measurement file in TDMS format and then specify the parameters that were used during the measurement by clicking the second icon. After indicating the path to the measurement file and filling in the used parameters, confirm your choices by pressing the third icon.

### Analysis view
Once you confirm your selections, you are automatically taken to the data analysis tab. You will see three graphs - the first corresponds to the entire file, the second to the range corresponding to idling, and the third to the cutting process. Select the appropriate ranges by manually moving the green and red rectangles, and adjust their borders. Before validating your selections, indicate whether you want the data to be added to the database. If ready, press the blue button below the charts.

### Filters view
Digital signal processing functionality has also been made available to the user. A moving average filter can be used, as well as a frequency spectrum. The cards are visible at the top of the window. The visible ranges are automatically truncated for the cutting process only (green rectangle).
