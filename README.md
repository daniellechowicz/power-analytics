## Introduction

### What is Power Analytics?

<p align="justify">
The application was developed to enable knowledge extraction from data produced during wood and wood-based material cutting experiments. The application is connected to a local database in which all the performed measurements are stored. Each record stores the parameters and the dependent variable, which is the power consumption of the woodworking machine. The parameters can be divided into three subgroups:
</p>

- parameters related to the material being cut itself,
- parameters related to the cutting process,
- parameters related to the cutting tool.

<p align="justify">
Due to the multitude of parameters, multivariate analysis and - in the long term - tool optimization are possible.
</p>

### What can Power Analytics do?

<p align="justify">
Some of the features of the software are as follows:
</p>

- modern and user-friendly graphic interface
- storage of all measurements in a database allowing for gradual increase of knowledge
- storing tools in the database and tracking and saving the changes made, which prevents the loss of data when updating the database with new data from the main enterprise system
- database records can be customized
- available data can be exported in CSV format for further analysis (both data from the database and data from the charts)
- available graphs can be saved in a variety of formats, including vector graphics formats; the range of graphs can be manually adjusted, saving only the interesting parts
- after each measurement a report is generated in PDF format, containing used parameters, graphs and basic statistics
- it is possible to view historical reports - the reports are saved by default, so that access to them is guaranteed at any time
- intuitive graphical interface for multi-parameter data visualization enables easy browsing of available measurements and searching for potential correlations

</p>

## Overview

<p align="justify"> 
This chapter describes an example use of the software and the procedure to analyze the data. A detailed description of the various functionalities is described in the next section.
</p>

### Main view

<p align="justify">
After launching the application, you will see the main window from which you can navigate to the various functionalities of the software. The tabs shown on the left are:
</p>

- data import and parameter entry,
- cutting and idle range selection and signal analysis including spectrum visualization,
- database and multi-parameter data visualization,
- reporting,
- settings.

</p>

### Importing data and entering parameters

<p align="justify">
Head to the first tab and then enter the path to the measurement file. If you do not have any measurement files in TDMS format, go to the _samples_ folder, which contains sample files. Confirm your selection. The next step is to enter the measurement parameters, including:
</p>

- author,
- material,
- material moisture content,
- rotational speed,
- feed speed,
- cutting width,
- cutting depth,
- tool ID,
- comment.

<p align="justify">
Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk. To avoid conflicts related to different data types, special validators have been added to allow the use of specific data types. Validators allow only one special character (comma; no other special characters are allowed, making fields error-proof). The data types for each field are as follows:
</p>

- author: <i>any</i>,
- material: <i>string</i>,
- material moisture content: <i>integer</i>,
- rotational speed: <i>float</i>,
- feed speed: <i>float</i>,
- cutting width: <i>float</i>,
- cutting depth: <i>float</i>,
- tool ID: <i>any</i>,
- comment: <i>any</i>.

<p align="justify"> 
Once the parameters have been entered, it is necessary to confirm them and then move on to the next tab by clicking the confirm button located on the right side of the window.
</p>

<p align="center">

  <p align="center">
    Fig. 4. Parameters widget
  </p>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Since many of the parameters are categorical variables, it was necessary to limit the choices (due to the functionality described later in the documentation, which is multiparameter visualization). This includes material, cutting direction, and tool ID. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
The material must first be defined by going to the next window by pressing the <i>Bearbeiten</i> button. By default the software uses capital letters, so the font does not play an important role. After adding material, reset parameters window to refresh database with available materials. When you want to remove some material from the database, open again the window, enter the name of the material you want to remove and then press the <i>LÃ¶schen</i> button.
</p>

  </p>
</p>

### Range selection and signal visualization

<p align="justify"> 
The next step required for a correct analysis is to mark the idle and cutting ranges. The main widget consists of three smaller charts. The first chart corresponds to the chart that is used to select the cutting and idle ranges. The second chart corresponds to the idle process, and the third chart, located at the bottom, corresponds to cutting. The graphs are responsive and update as the user makes changes.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
The green rectangle is for cutting and the red rectangle is for idle process. The rectangles can be moved and stretched as desired. If a range outside the signal is selected, the indexes are assigned accordingly depending on the position of the rectangle (there is an appropriate function that takes care of validating the selected ranges and, in case of incorrect ranges, adjusts them accordingly to the analyzed signal).
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
Check or uncheck the checkbox next to the button, depending on your intention for the analysis. If the checkbox is unchecked, the data will not be added to the database, but you can still generate a report. Once you have made your selection, confirm it by clicking on the button below the graphs.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
After confirming, a report is generated in the background and you are taken to the next view which is a visualization of the filtered signal. Two more views are available: the raw data visualization and the visualization of the signal transformed to the frequency domain.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
<b>Tip I:</b> you can zoom in and out by holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse up and down (increase or decrease the amplitude, respectively) or right and left (increase or decrease the range of the visible window, respectively).
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
<b>Tip II:</b> by pressing the right mouse button on the chart, additional options appear that may be useful to you. The options are as follows:
</p>

- <i>View All</i>
- <i>X Axis</i>
- <i>Y Axis</i>
- <i>Mouse Mode</i>
  - <i>3 Button</i>
  - <i>1 Button</i>
- <i>Plot Options</i>
  - <i>Transforms</i>
    - <i>Power Spectrum (FFT)</i>
    - <i>Log X</i>
    - <i>Log Y</i>
    - <i>dy/dx</i>
    - <i>Y vs. Y'</i>
  - <i>Downsample</i>
  - <i>Average</i>
  - <i>Alpha</i>
  - <i>Grid</i>
  - <i>Points</i>
- <i>Export</i>

### Report

<p align="justify"> 
The software has the functionality of generating reports.Reports are generated automatically (saved in the project folder for later use to open historical reports directly from the database), as well as on user request with saving in a defined folder (appropriate icon in the left sidebar). A sample auto-generated report is shown below.

<p align="justify"> 
The first two databases (i.e. <i>metadata</i> and <i>statistics</i>) can be seen in the window under <i>Datenbank</i>. The third database (i.e. <i>materials</i>) is only used in the parameters window.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
Navigating to the database window displays all the records available in the database. The records can be edited by pressing the <i>Bearbeiten</i> button, or exported in CSV format for further analysis by pressing the <i>Speichern als CSV</i> button. In order to edit a record, it is necessary to enter the ID number of the measurement, as well as to indicate the field you want to edit and to enter a new value. It is also possible to view old reports, which are stored in the folder <i>reports</i> in the project path. To view a report, press the record index on the left.

### Multiparameter visualization

### Settings

The user has access to some software settings. The settings can be accessed from the _Settings_ tab. The settings that can be changed are as follows:

1. channel name - the name that is given to the measurement file channel name when it is saved (avoid special characters)
2. sampling frequency - the sampling frequency used during the measurement specified in Hz
3. resampling factor - the factor by which the number of samples will be reduced (e.g. for a resampling factor of 10, the original number of samples of 1 MS will be 1 kS)
4. window size - the number of samples from which the moving average is calculated (the larger the window size, the less sensitive to noise and the more generalized the result)
5. idle start index - the default setting for the first measured value of the idle
6. idle stop index - the default setting for the last measured value of the idle
7. cutting start index - the default setting for the first measured value of the cutting
8. cutting stop index - the default setting for the last measured value of the cutting
9. CSV tools filename - the name of the CSV file that will contain the description of the tool parameters

### Troubleshooting

Error logs are saved in the _logs_ folder with the appropriate date. In case of any errors, please send the file to _d.lechowicz@wood-kplus.at_.
